# *Pull Request*

***Good Pull Request***

- First, fork our repository.
- Then, clone the repository you forked.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
    ```
- Install `pre-commit` if you haven't already.
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit  # if not already installed
    pre-commit install
    ```
- Create a new branch; it is not advisable to use the default branch (our default branch is `main`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
    ```
- Make the changes you desire.
- Then, add the changes using `git add`.
- Commit your changes with `git commit`.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: add the latest feature to phantom"
    ```
  
  **Suggested commit message formats**:
  - `feat:` for adding algorithms or other features;
  - `fix:` for modifying existing algorithms or fixing issues;
  - `docs:` for changing or creating documentation;
  - `add:` for adding algorithms or other features (optional);

  Note: The commit message should briefly explain the changes.
